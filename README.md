# open-calendar
Open-calendar is an online calendar that doesn't require login or auth. You create a calendar and get a permalink. Anyone with that permalink can use the calendar.

## Installation and useage
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/lucahuber/opencalendar.git`
2. Switch to server folder: `cd server`
2. Install node modules: `npm install`
3. Start server: `npm start` or if you use nodemon `npm install nodemon -g` call `nodemon index`

Starting the webpage and calling the NodeJs REST-API without running server will return hard-coded sample data located in app/assets/js/app.js
